            1. WHAT IS A SURFSKATE BOARD?
            surfskate is a skateboard that allows movements identical to surfing, surfskates are often used as surf trainers or by anybody
             else who enjoys surfing asphalt and concrete waves.
            Surfskate decks are directional decks, so there is always a front and a back and you ride them into one direction, just like a 
            surfboard. Most surfskates have a conventional skateboard or longboard truck at the tail of the board and a special surfskate truck
            at the nose of the board. Compared to regular skateboard trucks the axle of a surfskate truck does not only pivot but can also turn. 
            Most surfskate brands have built-in springs in their trucks that make the axle bounce back to the center.
            The high sensitivity and rotating axle of the front truck allows you not only to practice various surf maneuvers but also to pump the 
            board instead of pushing it, meaning you can build up speed with both feet on the board.
